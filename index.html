			Trans-Canada Hyperloop is a Hyperloop route design competition for the Ottawa Valley. The goal is to use the Hyperloop concept to educate teams about infrastructure planning, effective communication, and the ways in which innovation can change lives everywhere.

			Welcome to the 2018 Competition guide for the TransCanada Hyperloop Route Design Challenge for the Ottawa Valley! This is the first Hyperloop Route Design Challenge hosted by TransCanada Hyperloop. The competition hopes to bring together youth and transportation technologies closer than ever before, by providing youth the opportunity to engage in transportation planning and infrastructure design from the local, municipal, and governmental level. The competition hopes to allow secondary school and above students to gather and earn points through active and effective communication about hyperloop infrastructure. This competition will allow students to connect with resources such as Transpod and Waterloop that will educate and guide them on hyperloop technologies and infrastructure.
			
			This guide will help lead you through all the information related to the competition. The guide will go through stages of the competition from an overview of the program to the end of competition including competition details and many other valuable resources. The guide will also provide educators and learners a perspective of how the competition will run and what the competitors will learn and encounter on the way.

			The competition will first start off at the initial kick-off event where participants will be able to register for the competition and be matched with a team. The team will then gain access to an online communication platform, Slack, and begin the competition upon the start of the event. The competition encourages students to work together and communicate with people they have never met in order to fulfill the criterion needed to gain competition credits. These credits will go towards a point system that will later help to determine the performance of each team. The point system and criterion will be available to each contestant prior to the beginning of the competition. Finally, the competition will come to an end with each team delivering a presentation in front of a panel of experts for final judgement. The competition winners will be determined through the credits collected and the final presentation.
			
			The competition will have its initial kickoff on January 15th, 2018 at high schools in Deep River and Arnprior. These kickoffs will include presentation of the competition along with presentations from Waterloop and Transpod. Upon completion of the kickoffs, a website will be available for students to begin registering for the competition. Once students have registered, they will be contacted with additional information about the competition and when they will have access to their Slack accounts. The competition will last for approximately 2 months ending on March 24th, 2018. During this time, students will communicate with their teammates over Slack and gather points and prepare for their final presentation. Once the competition ends in March, we hope to receive feedback from students and generate enough interest to develop the competition throughout Canada.
